# Statistical_analysis_CLT_Tgrowthdata

The analysis performed in this repo, can be divided into two components.

## Use the exponential distribution in R and compare its distribution with the Central Limit Theorem
## Explore the toothGrowth dataset and provide statistical inference on the effect of dosage administration type and quantity of dosage for rate of increase in length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs

#### 1. The first part visits the exponential distribution in R and compares its distribution with the Central Limit Theorem. rexp(n,lambda) is used to simulate the exponential distribution in R, lambda denoting the rate parameter.

The objectives of this document would be to

. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
. Show how variable the sample is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

#### 2. The tooth growth dataset is explored in the second part. The data consists of the increase in length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each pig was administered a set dosage od vitamin C by one of the delivery methods.

The dosage for vitamin C was set at 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day

The delivery methods were through orange juice, or ascorbic acid.

The  data frame consists of 60 observations with 3 variables

The following tasks are performed

. Perform some basic exploratory data analyses
. Provide a basic summary of the data.
. Usage of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supplement and dose. 
. Conclusions and the assumptions needed for arriving at the conclusions
